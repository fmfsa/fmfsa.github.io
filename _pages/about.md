Hi, I am a 1st-year PhD Student in Machine Learning at [Machine Learning for Smart Mobility](https://mlsm.man.dtu.dk/) group at [Danish Technical University](https://www.dtu.dk/). I am supervised by Professor [Francisco Camara Pereira](https://www.dtu.dk/english/person/francisco-camara-pereira?id=104358&entity=profile) and Associate Professor [Carlos M. Lima Azevedo](https://www.dtu.dk/english/person/carlos-m-lima-azevedo?id=134225&entity=profile). Previously I received my master's degree in Aerospace Engineering at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). 

**Research Interests:** I am interested in Machine Learning and AI, particularly how they can be leveraged to support Transportation and Climate Change models. Specifically, my recent focus has been:
 - Causality, more specifically Causal Discovery and Causal Representation Learning
 - Active Learning
 - Invariant prediction and out-of-distribution generalization
 - Bayesian ML and Deep Generative Models
